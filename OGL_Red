OpenGL.

Immediate Mode - Calls to GPU directly cause Rendering to occur

Retained Mode - Buffers are maintained and sent to the GPU. 
Once sent the Code cannot access and modify the buffer

Fixed Function Pipeline - Present before the advent of Shaders.


Object Model - Generate Required No. of Objects. Bind One of them

Work with the bound object.

Unbind them and finally delete them

Communicating between Shaders and OGL Code - 

Inputs from Code to Shader must go via attributes.
Attributes can be created by first uploading the inputs into a buffer and having an attribute pointer to the location of that buffer.

The Vertex Attribute must be enabled before use

Attributes are associated with Vertex Array Objects and a VAO 
must be bound before any calls

REMEMBER TO UNBIND BUFFERS ONCE DONE WITH THEM!!

ALWAYS CLEAR COLOR WHEN DRAWING.
